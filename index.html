      <p class="content">
        Wild Rydes was started by two aspiring tech nerds. The two long-time friends, Steve and Kevin happened to leave an event in Dallas. They called for an Uber. When the Uber arrived, the request was to drive them to Dallas-Forth Worth airport to catch a flight back to New York City.  The Uber driver acknowledged the request. Unfortunately, the Uber driver was so into his music, he was heading to Dallas-Love Field Airport instead. The two friends began to panic. It dawn to them that they will be missing their flights back to New York for their important function. The two friends could not catch any other flights and were forced to rent a car. They embarked on a 23-hour, non-stop drive from Dallas to NYC. During the long drive, Steve wanted to listen to Taylor Swift, but Kevin wanted to hear Justin Bieber--the driver chose the music. At that point, they came up with an idea, why not come up with an alternative--that beats Uber and airlines? They decided to launch their own travel vehicle. An alternative that beats traffic. An infallible alternative. Let's travel on a UNICORN. Let's start WildRydes.
